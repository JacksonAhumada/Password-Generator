# Module-3-Challenge

## Discription

I wanted to give users a way to generate a random password based off of multiple perameters that they could select. The password had to be random and had to be complex enough to give the user a secure password. 

## Usage 

Go to the website and click the generate password button, answer the prompts according to what you want included in your password, and use your new password!!
